1. Define the Project Goal
   - Objective: Develop a translation app that transcribes spoken language into text, translates it into another language, and then converts it back into speech.
   - Steps:
     1. Identify Interests: We are interested in language translation using AI-powered voice and text processing.
     2. Problem Statement: The project aims to create a translation app that leverages AI models for speech-to-text (Whisper AI), text translation (Google Translate API), and text-to-speech (Bark AI).
     3. Define Success: We will create a user-friendly app that accurately transcribes, translates, and vocalizes text with minimal latency.

 2. Conduct Preliminary Research
   - Objective: Gather information about the tools and techniques you'll be using.
   - Steps:
     1. Literature Review: Google and Samsung both have a translation apps however they do not work that well it is limited to some languages and it is not allowed to have tts
     2. Technology Exploration: Bark AI, Whisper AI, and Google Translate API are integrated into our app. 
     3. Feasibility Analysis: It is already feasible we are in the process of completing the back end

 3. Define Project Requirements
   - Objective: Clearly outline what your app will need to function effectively.
   - Steps:
     1. User Stories/Use Cases: “As a user, I want to speak into the app and receive a translated voice response”
     2. System Requirements: Python and react and django
     3. Data Requirements: For longer run needs to have more data to enable a trainable ai for better precision than google.

 4. Develop a Project Timeline
   - Objective: Manage your work and progress throughout the semester.
   - Steps:
     1. Algorithm Design: (Week 1-2 in process)
     2. Prototyping/Rough Backend: (Week 3-8)
     3. Finishing Up: Rest of the weeks
